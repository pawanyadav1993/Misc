Given Taks Solution : 

1) I used zika_data.csv as the original data file. The task was to seprate USA data and to change the 'Place' to 'State' and subsequent row values. Like Jacksonville-FL -> Florida.

2) First I made a intermediate file named output.csv that contain all USA data only.

3) I used that intermediate output.csv file as input file for my next task, where I changed the place name. 

4) The final file name is zinaloutput.csv.

5) I used Python to solve the problem, file path varies when run from different system.
