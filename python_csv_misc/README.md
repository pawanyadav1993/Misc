Given Taks Solution : 

1) Used zika_data.csv as the original data file. The task was to seprate USA data and to change the 'Place' to 'State' and subsequent row values. Like Jacksonville-FL -> Florida.

2) First, made a intermediate file named output.csv that contain all USA data only.

3) Used that intermediate output.csv file as input file for my next task, where I changed the place name. 

4) The final file name is zinaloutput.csv.

5) Used Python to solve the problem, file path varies when run from different system.

Thanks!
